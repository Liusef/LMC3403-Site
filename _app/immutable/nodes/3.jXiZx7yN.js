                Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a leader in the cloud services industry, not only in numbers, 
                but also in quality of your services. As a computer science major at Georgia Tech with concentrations 
                in artificial intelligence and computer systems/architecture, I would love an opportunity to work on a 
                service that allows so many developers to transform their visions into reality.  </p> <p class="svelte-usafb9">Through some of my recent projects and coursework, I’ve gotten exposure to both AWS and cloud 
                computing technology in general. During my most recent internship, I got to see how companies use cloud 
                computing technology to save costs and improve the customer experience. I also got to use AWS’s 
                tooling myself on one of my recent projects, which I instantly fell in love with.</p> <p class="svelte-usafb9">My experience has also prepared me to work on cloud computing systems. I’ve taken many courses on low l
                evel systems, like processor design, operating systems, OS design, distributed systems, and system design for 
                cloud computing. Additionally, I have experience working with applications running on the cloud, like 
                different projects that I’ve written that utilize services like Amazon’s EC2 and DynamoDB.</p> <p class="svelte-usafb9">I greatly appreciate this opportunity to contribute to Amazon Web Services and I hope to hear back from 
                you or your team soon. Thank you so much for your time and consideration.</p> <p class="svelte-usafb9">Sincerely,</p> <p class="svelte-usafb9">Joseph Liu</p>`;return{c(){e=l("div"),o=l("div"),o.innerHTML=s,this.h()},l(n){e=c(n,"DIV",{class:!0});var t=T(e);o=c(t,"DIV",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),_(o)!=="svelte-1d2cee2"&&(o.innerHTML=s),t.forEach(r),this.h()},h(){b(o,"max-width","800px"),w(e,"class","col-center")},m(n,t){p(n,e,t),C(e,o)},p:$,d(n){n&&r(e)}}}function M(i){let e,o,s,n;return e=new W({props:{img:D,title:"Cover Letter",$$slots:{default:[z]},$$scope:{ctx:i}}}),s=new j({props:{$$slots:{default:[L]},$$scope:{ctx:i}}}),{c(){f(e.$$.fragment),o=S(),f(s.$$.fragment)},l(t){d(e.$$.fragment,t),o=A(t),d(s.$$.fragment,t)},m(t,a){h(e,t,a),p(t,o,a),h(s,t,a),n=!0},p(t,[a]){const m={};a&1&&(m.$$scope={dirty:a,ctx:t}),e.$set(m);const u={};a&1&&(u.$$scope={dirty:a,ctx:t}),s.$set(u)},i(t){n||(v(e.$$.fragment,t),v(s.$$.fragment,t),n=!0)},o(t){g(e.$$.fragment,t),g(s.$$.fragment,t),n=!1},d(t){t&&r(o),y(e,t),y(s,t)}}}class G extends x{constructor(e){super(),k(this,e,null,M,I,{})}}export{G as component};
